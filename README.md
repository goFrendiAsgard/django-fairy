django-fairy
============

This is a project to make django development easier (just like in fairy-tale)
It will make template and static automatically.

Usage
-----
Run : "python django_fairy/django_fairy.py startproject your_new_project"
In your_new_project, run : "python manage.py fairy"


TODO
----
* When startapp performed, urls and admins should be added automatically (done)
* When startapp performed, global urls should include app url (done)
* Fairy app that include several function to avoid verbosity
