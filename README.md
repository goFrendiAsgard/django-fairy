django-fairy
============

This is a project to make django development easier (just like in fairy-tale)
It will make template and static automatically.

Usage
-----
Instead of performing django-admin.py startproject your_new_project, use
django-fairy.py startproject your_new_project

Instead of performing manage.py startapp your_new_app, use fairmanage.py startapp your_new_app

TODO
----
* When startapp performed, urls and admins should be added automatically
* When startapp performed, global urls should include app url
* Fairy app that include several function to avoid verbosity
